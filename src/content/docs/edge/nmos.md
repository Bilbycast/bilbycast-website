bilbycast-edge implements the broadcast-audio subset of the AMWA NMOS
specifications:

| Spec | Endpoint | Coverage |
|------|----------|----------|
| IS-04 v1.3 | `/x-nmos/node/v1.3/` | self, devices, sources, flows, senders, receivers |
| IS-05 v1.1 | `/x-nmos/connection/v1.1/` | single sender/receiver staged + active + transporttype + constraints |
| IS-08 v1.0 | `/x-nmos/channelmapping/v1.0/` | io, map/active, map/staged, map/activate (active map persists to disk) |
| BCP-004 | embedded in IS-04 receiver caps | constraint_sets for ST 2110 audio inputs |
| mDNS-SD | `_nmos-node._tcp` | best-effort registration via the `mdns-sd` crate |

## Format detection

Each flow's input is classified at IS-04 list time:

- `InputConfig::St2110_30` / `St2110_31` → `urn:x-nmos:format:audio`
- `InputConfig::St2110_40` → `urn:x-nmos:format:data`
- everything else → `urn:x-nmos:format:mux`

The same classifier drives the receiver `caps` block. Audio receivers
advertise BCP-004 constraint sets keyed by `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:*`
URNs (sample_rate, channel_count, sample_depth) so NMOS controllers can
reject incompatible senders before activation.

## BCP-004 receiver capabilities

```json
{
  "caps": {
    "media_types": ["audio/L16", "audio/L24"],
    "constraint_sets": [{
      "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:media_type": { "enum": ["audio/L16", "audio/L24"] },
      "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:sample_rate": { "enum": [{ "numerator": 48000 }] },
      "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:channel_count": { "enum": [2] },
      "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:sample_depth": { "enum": [24] }
    }]
  }
}
```

ST 2110-40 receivers advertise `media_types: ["video/smpte291"]`.
Non-ST-2110 receivers continue to advertise the historical
`video/MP2T` shape so existing NMOS controllers don't break.

## PTP clocks

When any flow on the node sets `clock_domain`, the IS-04 `/self`
resource includes a single PTP clock entry (`name: "clk0"`,
`ref_type: "ptp"`). Sources whose flow has `clock_domain` set
reference this clock by name. The `locked` field is reported as `false`
until live PTP integration lands; the manager UI uses
`FlowStats.ptp_state.lock_state` for the real view — see
[ST 2110](/edge/st2110/#ptp-integration) for the PTP architecture.

## IS-08 audio channel mapping

The IS-08 endpoints expose every ST 2110-30/-31 audio input and output
under `/io`. The active map is persisted to
`<config_dir>/nmos_channel_map.json` (next to `config.json`) and
reloaded on startup. Both staged and active maps support the standard
PUT/POST + activate workflow.

Bilbycast does not currently re-route channels internally — the map is
a passthrough — but the endpoints exist so external NMOS controllers
can stage and activate maps and the manager UI can render the channel
layout.

**Bounds**: at most 1024 outputs per map, at most 64 channels per
output. Controllers exceeding these limits receive a
`413 PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` response.

## mDNS-SD registration

On startup the edge calls a small `mdns-sd` helper to register
`_nmos-node._tcp` on the local link. Failures (no multicast on the
selected interface, daemon errors) are logged once and swallowed; flow
startup is never blocked. The handle is dropped on process exit, which
unregisters the service cleanly.

## Backward compatibility

Multi-essence audio + data resources are additive — old NMOS
controllers that only consumed `format:mux` continue to work because
mux flows are still classified the same way. The IS-08 router is
mounted under a fresh URL prefix and is invisible to controllers that
don't speak it. The mDNS-SD registration is supplementary to manual
NMOS registry configuration.

## Pending external validation

The following items are deferred until matching tooling becomes
available in the test lab:

- **AMWA NMOS Testing Tool** runs against IS-04, IS-05, IS-08, BCP-004.
  Expected pass matrix:
  - IS-04: pass on `test_01` (resources have valid UUIDs / formats /
    transports) through `test_19` (clocks).
  - IS-05: pass on staged/active round-trip for sender + receiver,
    with transport-file SDP advertisement for ST 2110 senders.
  - IS-08: pass on `io`, `map/active`, `map/staged`, `map/activate`
    happy paths.
  - BCP-004: pass on receiver caps containing `media_types` plus a
    `constraint_sets` block matching the configured sample rate /
    channel count / bit depth.
- **Sony NMOS Commissioning Tool** end-to-end smoke against a real
  Lawo or Riedel device.
