## Overview

bilbycast-edge is a pure-Rust media gateway supporting multiple transport protocols for professional broadcast and streaming workflows. All protocol implementations are native Rust with no C library dependencies. The compressed-audio egress path (`audio_encode`) is the one exception: it invokes ffmpeg at runtime via a subprocess, never linked.

## Input Protocols

### RTP (SMPTE ST 2022-2)
- **Direction:** Input
- **Transport:** UDP unicast or multicast, IPv4 and IPv6
- **Payload:** MPEG-2 Transport Stream in RTP per SMPTE ST 2022-2
- **Features:**
  - SMPTE 2022-1 FEC decode (column + row parity)
  - IGMP/MLD multicast group join with interface selection
  - Source IP allow-list filtering (RP 2129 C5)
  - RTP payload type filtering (RP 2129 U4)
  - Per-flow ingress rate limiting (RP 2129 C7)
  - DSCP/QoS marking on egress (RP 2129 C10)
  - VSF TR-07 mode: auto-detects JPEG XS streams

### UDP (Raw MPEG-TS)
- **Direction:** Input
- **Transport:** UDP unicast or multicast, IPv4 and IPv6
- **Payload:** Raw MPEG-TS datagrams (no RTP headers required)
- **Features:**
  - Accepts any UDP datagram (no RTP v2 header filtering)
  - IGMP/MLD multicast group join with interface selection
  - Compatible with OBS, ffmpeg `udp://` output, srt-live-transmit, VLC

### SRT (Secure Reliable Transport)
- **Direction:** Input
- **Transport:** UDP with ARQ retransmission
- **Modes:** Caller, Listener, Rendezvous
- **Features:**
  - AES-128/192/256 encryption (AES-CTR default, AES-GCM authenticated encryption selectable via `crypto_mode`)
  - Stream ID access control (`stream_id`, max 512 chars per SRT spec; supports `#!::r=name,m=mode,u=user` structured format)
  - FEC (Forward Error Correction) via `packet_filter` — XOR-based row/column parity, staircase layout, ARQ integration modes (`always`/`onreq`/`never`), wire-compatible with libsrt v1.5.5
  - Configurable latency buffer (symmetric or asymmetric receiver/sender latency)
  - Retransmission bandwidth capping (Token Bucket shaper via `max_rexmit_bw`)
  - SMPTE 2022-7 hitless redundancy merge (dual-leg input)
  - Automatic reconnection
  - **`transport_mode: "audio_302m"`** (deferred — see [Audio Gateway — Limitations](/edge/audio-gateway/#limitations-and-deferred-items)): demux SMPTE 302M LPCM-in-MPEG-TS from `ffmpeg -c:a s302m`, `srt-live-transmit`, or hardware encoders, and republish as RTP audio packets onto the broadcast channel

### `rtp_audio` (RFC 3551 PCM over RTP, no PTP)
- **Direction:** Input and Output
- **Transport:** UDP unicast or multicast, IPv4 and IPv6
- **Payload:** Big-endian L16 or L24 PCM in standard RFC 3551 RTP
- **Why it exists:** Wire-identical to SMPTE ST 2110-30 but with relaxed
  constraints — sample rates 32 / 44.1 / 48 / 88.2 / 96 kHz, no PTP
  requirement, no RFC 7273 timing reference, no NMOS `clock_domain`
  advertising. Use this for radio contribution feeds over the public
  internet, talkback between studios that don't share a PTP fabric, and
  ffmpeg / OBS / GStreamer interop where ST 2110-30's PTP assumption
  is overkill.
- **Features:**
  - Same `transcode` block as ST 2110-30 outputs (sample-rate / bit-depth
    / channel routing — see [Audio Gateway](/edge/audio-gateway/))
  - SMPTE 2022-7 dual-leg redundancy
  - Source IP allow-list filtering
  - **Output also supports** `transport_mode: "audio_302m"` to wrap the
    audio as SMPTE 302M-in-MPEG-TS inside RFC 2250 RTP/MP2T (PT 33)
    — useful for hardware decoders that consume MPEG-TS over RTP

## Output Protocols

### RTP (SMPTE ST 2022-2)
- **Direction:** Output
- **Transport:** UDP unicast or multicast
- **Payload:** RTP-wrapped MPEG-TS packets with RTP headers
- **Features:**
  - SMPTE 2022-1 FEC encode
  - DSCP/QoS marking (default: 46 Expedited Forwarding)
  - Multicast with interface selection
  - **MPTS passthrough** (default) or optional MPTS→SPTS program filter via `program_number`

### UDP (Raw MPEG-TS)
- **Direction:** Output
- **Transport:** UDP unicast or multicast
- **Payload:** Raw MPEG-TS datagrams (7×188 = 1316 bytes, no RTP headers)
- **Features:**
  - Strips RTP headers when input is RTP-wrapped
  - TS sync detection and packet alignment
  - DSCP/QoS marking
  - Compatible with ffplay, VLC, multicast distribution
  - **MPTS passthrough** (default) or optional MPTS→SPTS program filter via `program_number`
  - **`transport_mode: "audio_302m"`**: when the upstream input is an audio
    essence, run the per-output transcode + SMPTE 302M packetizer +
    TsMuxer pipeline and emit 7×188-byte MPEG-TS chunks containing
    48 kHz LPCM (16/20/24 bit, 2/4/6/8 channels) as plain UDP datagrams.
    Useful for legacy hardware decoders that consume raw MPEG-TS over
    UDP. Mutually exclusive with `program_number`. See
    [Audio Gateway](/edge/audio-gateway/) for the full pipeline.

### SRT (Secure Reliable Transport)
- **Direction:** Output
- **Modes:** Caller, Listener, Rendezvous
- **Features:**
  - AES encryption (AES-CTR or AES-GCM via `crypto_mode`)
  - Stream ID access control (`stream_id`, max 512 chars; callers send during handshake, listeners filter)
  - FEC (Forward Error Correction) via `packet_filter` — same capabilities as SRT input
  - Asymmetric latency support (independent receiver/sender latency)
  - Retransmission bandwidth capping (Token Bucket shaper)
  - SMPTE 2022-7 hitless redundancy duplication (dual-leg output)
  - Non-blocking mpsc bridge prevents TCP backpressure from affecting other outputs
  - Automatic reconnection
  - **MPTS passthrough** (default) or optional MPTS→SPTS program filter via `program_number`
  - **`transport_mode: "audio_302m"`**: when the upstream input is an
    audio essence, run the per-output transcode (force 48 kHz, even
    channels, 16/20/24-bit) + SMPTE 302M packetizer + TsMuxer (BSSD
    registration descriptor in PMT) + 1316-byte chunk bundling
    pipeline. Interoperable with `ffmpeg -c:a s302m`,
    `srt-live-transmit`, and broadcast hardware decoders that expect
    302M LPCM in MPEG-TS over SRT. Mutually exclusive with
    `packet_filter`, `program_number`, and 2022-7 redundancy. See
    [Audio Gateway](/edge/audio-gateway/) for the full pipeline,
    interop tests, and worked use cases.

### RTMP/RTMPS
- **Direction:** Input (publish) and Output (publish)
- **Transport:** TCP (RTMP) or TLS over TCP (RTMPS)
- **Use case:** Delivering to Twitch, YouTube Live, Facebook Live; ingesting from OBS, Wirecast, ffmpeg
- **Features:**
  - Pure Rust RTMP protocol implementation (handshake, chunking, AMF0)
  - Demuxes H.264 and AAC from MPEG-2 TS, muxes into FLV
  - Automatic AVC sequence header (SPS/PPS) and AAC config generation
  - Reconnection with configurable delay and max attempts
  - Non-blocking: uses mpsc bridge pattern, never blocks other outputs
  - **MPTS-aware:** on an MPTS input, selects program by `program_number` or (default) locks onto the lowest-numbered program in the PAT
  - **Optional `audio_encode` block (Phase B):** runs the input AAC through the ffmpeg-sidecar encoder so the operator can normalise bitrate / sample rate / channel count or upgrade to HE-AAC v1/v2 (`aac_lc`, `he_aac_v1`, `he_aac_v2`). Same-codec passthrough fast path skips both decoder and encoder when the source is already AAC-LC and no overrides are set. Requires ffmpeg in PATH at runtime; outputs without `audio_encode` keep working without ffmpeg installed. See [Audio Gateway — `audio_encode`](/edge/audio-gateway/#the-audio_encode-block--compressed-audio-egress-rtmp--hls--webrtc).
- **Limitations:**
  - Only H.264 video and AAC audio. HEVC/VP9 not supported via RTMP.
  - RTMPS (TLS) uses the `tls` feature (enabled by default).
  - Single-program by spec — only one program can be published per output.

### HLS Egress
- **Direction:** Output only
- **Transport:** HTTP PUT/POST over TCP
- **Use case:** YouTube HLS ingest (supports HEVC/HDR content)
- **Features:**
  - Segments MPEG-2 TS data into time-bounded chunks
  - Generates rolling M3U8 playlist
  - Configurable segment duration (0.5-10 seconds)
  - Optional Bearer token authentication
  - Async HTTP upload, non-blocking to other outputs
  - **MPTS passthrough** (default) or optional MPTS→SPTS program filter via `program_number` — filtered segments carry a rewritten single-program TS
  - **Optional `audio_encode` block (Phase B):** each segment is piped through `ffmpeg -i pipe:0 -c:v copy -c:a {codec} -f mpegts pipe:1` before HTTP PUT. Allowed codecs: `aac_lc`, `he_aac_v1`, `he_aac_v2`, `mp2`, `ac3`. Per-segment fork rather than a long-lived encoder because HLS segments are 2-6 s and ffmpeg startup is small relative to that — also lets MP2/AC-3 work without a new TS muxer. Requires ffmpeg in PATH; the output refuses to start if ffmpeg is missing and emits a Critical `audio_encode` event.
- **Limitations:**
  - Output only. Segment-based transport inherently adds 1-4 seconds of latency.
  - Uses a minimal built-in HTTP client (not a full HTTP/2 client).

### RTSP
- **Direction:** Input only
- **Transport:** TCP (interleaved) or UDP
- **Client library:** `retina` (pure Rust)
- **Features:**
  - Pull H.264 or H.265/HEVC video and AAC audio from IP cameras and media servers
  - Digest and Basic authentication support
  - TCP interleaved (default, works through firewalls) or UDP transport
  - Automatic reconnection with configurable delay
  - Received media is muxed into MPEG-TS with proper PAT/PMT program tables
  - Audio-only streams supported (PAT/PMT emitted even without video)
- **Limitations:**
  - Input only (no RTSP server mode)
  - AAC audio is passed through as ADTS in MPEG-TS

### SMPTE ST 2110-30 / -31 (PCM / AES3 audio)
- **Direction:** Input and Output
- **Transport:** RFC 3551 RTP/UDP, multicast or unicast, with
  IGMP/MLD multicast group join and interface selection
- **Payload:** Big-endian L16/L24 PCM (-30) or AES3 sub-frames (-31,
  always 24-bit, transparent to Dolby E and AES3 user/channel-status
  bits)
- **Wire constraints:** sample_rate 48000 / 96000 Hz; bit_depth 16 or
  24; channels 1, 2, 4, 8, 16; packet_time 125 / 250 / 333 / 500 / 1000
  / 4000 µs; payload_type 96–127
- **PTP:** best-effort PTP slave via the external `ptp4l` daemon's
  management Unix socket. PTP state surfaces through stats; no
  in-process PTP daemon ships with the edge.
- **Features:**
  - SMPTE 2022-7 dual-network ("Red"/"Blue") bind on input and output,
    with hitless merge on input via `engine::st2110::redblue::RedBluePair`
  - Source IP allow-list filtering (single-leg only)
  - **Per-output PCM transcode** (`transcode` block): sample-rate / bit-depth
    / channel-routing conversion via the lock-free `engine::audio_transcode`
    stage. IS-08 channel-map activations propagate without flow restart
    via a `tokio::sync::watch` channel — see
    [Audio Gateway](/edge/audio-gateway/) for the full feature set,
    presets, and worked examples.
  - **Compressed-audio ingress (Phase A):** when the upstream flow input is AAC-LC in MPEG-TS (carried over RTMP / RTSP / SRT / UDP / RTP), the in-process `engine::audio_decode::AacDecoder` (pure-Rust `symphonia-codec-aac`) turns it into f32 planar PCM so ST 2110-30 / -31 outputs — and the `srt` / `udp` / `rtp_audio` 302M output modes — can carry it without ffmpeg. Rejects HE-AAC, AAC-Main, and multichannel AAC with an `audio_decode` Critical event.
- **NMOS:** advertised as `urn:x-nmos:format:audio` in IS-04, with
  BCP-004 receiver caps reflecting the configured sample rate, channel
  count, and sample depth

### SMPTE ST 2110-40 (ancillary data)
- **Direction:** Input and Output
- **Transport:** RFC 8331 RTP/UDP
- **Payload:** Bit-packed RFC 8331 ANC (SCTE-104 ad markers, SMPTE 12M
  timecode, CEA-608/708 captions, AFD, CDP)
- **Features:**
  - Same SMPTE 2022-7 dual-network and source allow-list options as -30/-31
  - SCTE-104 messages auto-detected and emitted as `scte104` events
- **NMOS:** advertised as `urn:x-nmos:format:data` in IS-04. Receivers advertise `media_types: ["video/smpte291"]`.

### WebRTC (WHIP/WHEP)
- **Direction:** Input and Output
- **Transport:** UDP (ICE-lite/DTLS/SRTP) via `str0m` pure-Rust WebRTC stack
- **Status:** Fully implemented. The `webrtc` feature is enabled by default.
- **Four modes:**
  - **WHIP input** (server): Accept contributions from OBS, browsers — endpoint at `/api/v1/flows/{id}/whip`
  - **WHIP output** (client): Push media to external WHIP endpoints (CDN, cloud)
  - **WHEP output** (server): Serve browser viewers — endpoint at `/api/v1/flows/{id}/whep`
  - **WHEP input** (client): Pull media from external WHEP servers
- **Video:** H.264 only (RFC 6184 RTP packetization/depacketization)
- **Audio:** Opus passthrough by default — Opus flows natively on WebRTC paths and gets muxed into MPEG-TS for SRT/RTP/UDP outputs. **Without `audio_encode`, AAC sources going to a WebRTC output automatically fall back to video-only.** Setting an `audio_encode` block (codec: `opus`) enables the Phase B chain: input AAC-LC is decoded in-process via the Phase A `engine::audio_decode::AacDecoder` and re-encoded as Opus via the Phase B ffmpeg-sidecar `engine::audio_encode::AudioEncoder`, then written to the WebRTC audio MID via str0m. This is the marquee Phase A+B chain — **AAC RTMP contribution → Opus WebRTC distribution** — all inside one bilbycast-edge process with no external transcoder. Requires `video_only=false` and ffmpeg in PATH.
- **MPTS-aware outputs:** on an MPTS input, WHIP/WHEP outputs select program by `program_number` or (default) lock onto the lowest-numbered program in the PAT. Single-program by spec.
- **Interoperability:** Compatible with OBS, browsers, Cloudflare, LiveKit, and other standard WHIP/WHEP implementations.
- **Security:** Bearer token authentication on WHIP/WHEP endpoints, DTLS/SRTP encryption, ICE-lite for server modes.
- **NAT traversal:** Configurable `public_ip` and optional `stun_server` for ICE candidate advertisement.

## MPEG-TS Program Handling

### MPTS / SPTS Support
- **All TS-carrying inputs** (UDP, RTP, SRT) accept both **SPTS** (single-program) and **MPTS** (multi-program) transport streams. Non-TS inputs (RTMP, RTSP, WebRTC) synthesise a single-program TS internally.
- **TS-native outputs** (UDP, RTP, SRT, HLS) pass the full MPTS through by default. Each output may opt into a per-program filter via `program_number`, which rewrites the PAT to a single-program form and drops packets for every PID that isn't part of the selected program. FEC (2022-1) and hitless redundancy (2022-7) protect the filtered bytes, so receivers see a valid SPTS.
- **Re-muxing outputs** (RTMP, WebRTC) and the **thumbnail generator** honour the same `program_number` field to select which program's elementary streams to extract. The default (unset) locks onto the lowest `program_number` in the PAT for deterministic behaviour.
- **Per-output scope:** one flow can fan an MPTS out to multiple outputs, each locked onto a different program, while a sibling output forwards the full MPTS unchanged.

## Monitoring and Analysis

### TR-101290 Transport Stream Analysis
- Priority 1: Sync byte, continuity counter, PAT/PMT presence
- Priority 2: TEI, PCR discontinuity, PCR accuracy
- Runs as independent broadcast subscriber (zero jitter impact)
- Skipped automatically for non-TS inputs (ST 2110-30/-31/-40, `rtp_audio`, WebRTC)

### MPEG-TS Program Analysis
- Parses PAT and every PMT from the input broadcast channel
- Reports **per-program stream breakdown** in the manager UI: each program's video PIDs (codec, resolution, frame rate, profile, level) and audio PIDs (codec, sample rate, channels, language)
- Handles PAT/PMT version bumps and programs coming/going mid-stream
- `program_count` in stats reflects the number of programs advertised in the PAT

### VSF TR-07 Awareness
- Auto-detects JPEG XS (stream type 0x61) in PMT
- Reports TR-07 compliance status via API and dashboard
- Enable with `tr07_mode: true` in RTP input config

### SMPTE Trust Boundary Metrics (RP 2129)
- Inter-arrival time (IAT): min/max/avg per reporting window
- Packet delay variation (PDV/jitter): RFC 3550 exponential moving average
- Filtered PDV (CMAX): peak-to-peak filtered metric
- Source IP filtering (C5), payload type filtering (U4), rate limiting (C7)
- DSCP/QoS marking (C10)
- Per-flow bandwidth monitoring for trust boundary enforcement
- Flow health derivation (M6): Healthy/Warning/Error/Critical

## Cargo Features

| Feature | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `tls` | Enable RTMPS (RTMP over TLS) via `rustls`/`tokio-rustls` | **Yes** |
| `webrtc` | Enable WebRTC WHIP/WHEP input and output via `str0m` | **Yes** |

All features are enabled by default. A plain `cargo build --release` includes everything.

## Architecture Notes

- All outputs subscribe to a shared broadcast channel independently
- Slow outputs receive `Lagged` errors and drop packets — they never block the input or other outputs
- TCP-based outputs (RTMP, HLS) use an mpsc bridge pattern to keep TCP operations off the broadcast receive path
- All monitoring (TR-101290, IAT/PDV, TR-07) runs on independent analyzer tasks with zero impact on the data plane
